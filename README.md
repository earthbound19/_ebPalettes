# _ebPalettes

Collection of palettes in `.hexplt` format, which is a list of RGB colors in hex format, one per line, like this:

    #002147
    #003153
    #333366
    #32127a
    #79443b
    #a45a52

I invented this format, I think, but I wouldn't be surprised if others have done the same. It is for use in creative coding, for example in writing scripts or generative art that operates on or imports lists of colors.

## Markdown galleries

If you're viewing this repository at a web site such as GitHub or other context that renders HTML from the README.md, you may navigate the folders to see previews of palettes (rendered as .png images) via that README. You'll find palettes displayed like the below:

### [`palettes/RAHfavoriteColorsHex`](palettes/RAHfavoriteColorsHex.hexplt)

[ ![palettes/RAHfavoriteColorsHex.png](palettes/RAHfavoriteColorsHex.png) ](palettes/RAHfavoriteColorsHex.png)

-- where the title over the image links to the source `.hexplt` file, and the rendered image links to the image file.

## Scripts that render palettes and galleries

Some scripts I have developed that created the palettes, palette renders and markdown galleries in this repository are [renderAllHexPalettes.sh]( https://github.com/earthbound19/_ebDev/blob/master/scripts/imgAndVideo/renderAllHexPalettes.sh) and [palettesMarkdownGalleries.sh](https://github.com/earthbound19/_ebDev/blob/master/scripts/imgAndVideo/palettesMarkdownGalleries.sh).

## Sources of Maths

Palettes in this collection are generated randomly and/or made by me, or may be collected from elsewhere.

Where they are collected from elsewhere, I'm careful to avoid intellectual property concerns by referring only to public domain information (such as sources or times), without using any copyrightable or trademarkeable etc. information. The public domain information I use includes the math of what numbers are concerned with what palettes. You can't exert intellectual property control on numbers.

## LICENSE

As you may infer from "Sources of Maths," since these palettes are collections of numbers, and you can't copyright numbers, the palettes in this repository are outside of any possible licensing constraints: these palletes are in the Public Domain. But unique _names_ of palettes which I have given to any of them, I reserve all copyright control of. If the palette name is random characters and/or numbers and/or dates, that goes back to the name being arguably a number or something random or which has little or no unique intellectual property attributes, which makes those names also arguably Public Domain.
